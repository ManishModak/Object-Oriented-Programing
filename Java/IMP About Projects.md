Project No.1(Prime No.)               :  Nested If Else 
Problem Statement                     :  Write a Java program for:
                                                   1. Whether a given number prime or not.
                                                   2. To print the pair of prime numbers for given range.
                                   
Project No.2(Complex)                 :  Constructor
Problem Statement                     :  Design a class Complex with data members for real and imaginary part. 
                                         Provide default Parameterized  constructors.  
                                         Write  a  program  to perform  arithmetic  operations  of  two  complex 
                                         numbers.
                         
Project No.3(Student DataBase)        : Class and Object , Array Of Objects
Problem Statement                     : Design a class to store student Info.
                                        Create A array of Objects To store Data Of Multiple Students.
                                 
Project No.4(Constructor Overloading) : static variable and method , array of object, and constructor overloading.
Problem Statement                     : A bag consists of zero or more objects of the same type. Each object can be
                                        described by its color and weight. Design a Java program to create a new
                                        object. This can be done in two ways. If the user provides information about
                                        color and/or weight of the object to be created then this information will be
                                        used to create the object otherwise the object will be created using default
                                        values for these attributes. Provide a facility to keep track of total number of
                                        objects and total weight of object from a bag. Use static variable and
                                        method, array of object, and constructor overloading.
                                        
Project No.5(Inheritance)             : Inheritance , Super keyword , Array of Objects , Switch Case 
Problem Statement                     : Design a class 'Person' with data members 
                                        name, age, DOB, employee id, PAN card number, mobile number, and email id.
                                        Inherit the classes: Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor.
                                        Add Basic Pay (BP) and Department Name as the member of all the inherited classes.
                                        Generate pay slips for the employees with their gross and net salary.
                                        Calculate the salary with 119% of BP as DA, 30 % of BP as HRA, 
                                        12% of BP as PF (deduction), 0.1% of BP (deduction) for staff club fund.
                                        
Project No.6(Hierarchical Inheritance) : Inheritance , Abstract Class & Methods , Switch Case
Problem Statement                      : Design a base class Shape with two double type values and methods to input the data and compute_area()
                                         for calculating area of shape. Derive three classes: triangle, rectangle, and circle.
                                         Make compute_area() as abstract method and redefine this method in the derived class to suit their requirements.
                                         Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle/circle and display calculated area.
                                         Implement dynamic binding for given case study.
